# Divine Mantra
The Divine Mantra is provided online at [Access to Insight](http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/thai/lee/divinemantra.html) by Ajaan Lee Dhammadaro and translated by Ṭhānissaro Bhikkhu.

This specific document project is here to help me learn and improve two simple parts of my life. I want to engage with the Divine Mantra more easily and more often on my mobile device. I also want to learn how to use HTML and CSS to make this page and many similar pages enjoyable to read. This approach seems to make me happy by the end of the day.

Right now my goal with the Divine Mantra is to improve how to apply basic HTML5 and CSS3 skills. If I manage to live long enough, I would also love to learn how to apply JavaScript. Your thoughts about what I could be doing better are very open for me to hear.
